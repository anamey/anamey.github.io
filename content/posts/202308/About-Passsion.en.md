From some point of time, I realized that one type of life is to find what you are passionated about, and live a life on the things you truly into. The early years of my life lived on what others lived, on what others choose, on the life even others don't know why they live on such life. I started questioning about my life - why I have to live on the world; if this is what I can not choose, why I live on such type of life; what is the meaning of my life; what kind of life I want to live on; I want to find the motivation or find where is my motivation from. Of course, such thoughts occurs when I feel stuggeled or sometimes occurs when I have lots of free time to think, to examine my life. 
Then it comes to one kind of answer - I need to find what I am passionated about, what I really like and spend my time, my life on the things I am into it. Most of past years I spent on the main stream tradition, and did the 'right' thing before I knew exactly what I wanted to do. Some of them equipped me with the fundamental skills I need to live in the modern society, some of them give me unnessesary extra pressure.  
Now that I know I need to follow my passion, my heart. The next question is how do I know what's my passion?
