So here are my plan:
This is my current leetcode records:
![Progress0802](/images/leetcode0802.png "Progress0802")
By the end of August, I want to resolve 1000 problems in total. I'll start from topic of Graph, and the problem from some company lists.
To reach this goal, I need to solve at least 13 problems per day and 30 days in a row. 
If it takes 30 mins to solve a problem, it will take 6.5 hour per day to finish the daily goal.
Let's do it!
